* Now open a terminal on VS Code and type in the following command (Replace XXX with your account username for CSE15L):
> ssh XXX@ieng6.ucsd.edu

* Next, when prompted, type “yes” into the terminal.
* Now, enter your password. Don’t worry if nothing appears on the screen while you are typing your password - that’s how it works in the terminal!

* This is what the setup would look like:

## TRYING SOME COMMANDS
* I created a directory “ishika” and “cse15l” using _mkdir_
* Then I navigate into the “ishika” directory using _cd_
* Then I create another directory “helloworld” inside “ishika”
* I display all directories using _ls_
